# PHASE 1 – Proposal & Planning

# Literature search: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which causes a decline in cognitive functions until death. It is the main cause of dementia and rapidly increasing worldwide, roughly doubling every 5 years. The direct cause  is still an issue of hot debate, but the literature has many risk factors listed such as: “increasing age, genetic factors, head injuries, vascular diseases, infections, and environmental factors” (Breijyeh & Karaman, 2020). From a clinical standpoint, AD patients exhibit “memory loss… change of personality… progressive loss of cognitive functions” (Breijyeh & Karaman, 2020). 
From a molecular standpoint, autopsies have revealed  neuritic plqaues and neurofibrillary tangles, which are predicted to be caused by amyloid-beta (AB plaques).
