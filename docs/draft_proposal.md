(EMAIL)"issue: lack of details. They are too brief and have very little substance."

1) Please provide details on

   - the datasets,
   - \# of obs,
   - \# columns,
   - what the columns are and their types.
   - If it is geographical,
     - what areas it covers,
   - if it is time series,
     - what time frame it covers.
   - What is the label you want to predict,
   - what are the features you use to predict the label.
2) What ML models you plan to use, how will you compare them and pick the best?
3) if you deploy the ML model to a webapp, what the functions it will provide?
4) Make sure you perform the initial EDA and have a jupyter notebook file in src with good documentations.

# [1.1] DATASETS

I originally found the dataset on [Hum Data's dataset collection](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/who-data-for-united-states-of-america), which itself is sourced from the [World Health Organization's (WHO) dataset](https://www.who.int/data/gho) on [Global Health Indicators](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators). These Global Health Indicators come from the [Global Health Observatory (GHO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Health_Observatory) which is the division of the WHO which shares global data specific to health measures by country.

The dataset I've chosen to look are the Health Measures for the US, which is updated monthly and is currently up to JAN 2023.
